# ElePose

This is the original implementation of "ElePose: Unsupervised 3D Human Pose Estimation by Predicting Camera Elevation and Learning Normalizing Flows on 2D Poses" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07088.pdf).

To train on the Human3.6M dataset it requires preprocessed data. Since the license does not allow to upload the data here I will upload a conversion script in the next days. It relies on the preprocessing the dataset with H36m-fetch (https://github.com/anibali/h36m-fetch).
